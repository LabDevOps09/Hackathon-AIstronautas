# Space Storytelling and Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is designed to create a cohesive system that integrates multiple agents to fetch space data, generate sci-fi stories, create mission blueprints, and suggest relevant visuals. The system is built using Python and leverages various APIs to fetch real-time space data.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several key components, each handled by a specific agent:

1. **Space Researcher Agent**: Fetches space-related data from APIs like NASA, ESA, and SpaceX.
2. **Storytelling Agent**: Generates sci-fi stories based on real space data.
3. **Simulation Generator Agent**: Creates mission blueprints based on user inputs.
4. **Visualization Agent**: Suggests relevant space visuals based on the generated stories or missions.
